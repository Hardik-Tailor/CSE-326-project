        <p id="ttb" class="TTB"><b>Top 5 Tips for Saving on Cab Fares</b></p>
        <p id="ttdis" class="TTDIS">When it comes to saving on cab fares, planning ahead can make a significant difference. Start by comparing prices across different platforms like Ola, Uber, and Rapido to find the best deal. Additionally, consider traveling during off-peak hours when fares are typically lower. Lastly, keep an eye out for promotional codes and discounts that can further reduce your costs. <br><br>

            Another effective strategy is to share rides with friends or family. Not only does this make the journey more enjoyable, but it also allows you to split the fare, making it more affordable for everyone involved. Furthermore, many cab services offer loyalty programs that reward frequent users with discounts and special offers. Signing up for these programs can lead to substantial savings over time. <br><br>
            
            Lastly, always check for surge pricing before booking your ride. During high-demand periods, fares can increase significantly, so it may be worth waiting a little while for prices to drop. By implementing these tips, you can enjoy your travels without breaking the bank on cab fares.</p>
