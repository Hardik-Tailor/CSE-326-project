        <p id="ttb" class="TTB"><b>The Future of Cab Services: What to Expect</b></p>
        <p id="ttdis" class="TTDIS">The cab service industry is evolving rapidly, with technology playing a crucial role in shaping its future. One of the most significant trends is the integration of artificial intelligence to enhance user experience. AI can help predict demand, optimize routes, and provide personalized recommendations for users. This means that travelers can expect faster and more efficient rides in the near future. <br><br>

            Another exciting development is the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles. As environmental concerns grow, many cab services are transitioning to electric fleets, reducing their carbon footprint. Additionally, the introduction of self-driving cars could revolutionize the way we think about transportation, making rides more accessible and affordable for everyone. <br><br>
            
            Lastly, the focus on safety and hygiene has never been more critical. Post-pandemic, cab services are implementing stricter health protocols to ensure passenger safety. Expect features like contactless payments, enhanced sanitation measures, and real-time tracking to become standard in the industry, making your travel experience safer and more convenient.</p>
